## Project Overview  
This repository demonstrates an integration between **Salesforce** (CRM platform) and **Neo4j** (graph-database) using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, incorporating the concept of **GraphRAG** (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation).  
The goal is to enable Salesforce to leverage graph-based insights (via Neo4j) for enhanced customer, case, or relationship analytics ‚Äî such as multi-hop queries, similarity search and semantic understanding of data relationships.

This project showcases four distinct integration methods, leveraging Apex, LWC, and Named Credentials within Salesforce, and querying Neo4j via MCP servers ‚Äî staying entirely within the Salesforce and Neo4j ecosystem.

---

## Key Technologies  
- **Salesforce**: Apex, LWC, Named Credentials, Flow automation  
- **Neo4j**: Graph modelling (nodes, relationships, properties), Cypher query language  
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Standardized protocol connecting AI models to tools and databases  
- **GraphRAG**: Combines vector embeddings + graph context for richer retrieval and insights  

---

## Architecture & Methods  

### Method 1: Manual Cypher RAG  
**Flow:** Salesforce ‚Üí MCP Gateway ‚Üí Neo4j (manual Cypher queries)  
**Highlights:** Developer writes Cypher queries manually; best for full  control over grounding.

### Method 2: Retriever RAG  
**Flow:** Salesforce ‚Üí Gateway -> Retriever ‚Üí Neo4j  
**Highlights:** Converts natural language to Cypher via retriever. Then use that for grounding.

### Method 3: No-RAG Integration  
**Flow:** Salesforce ‚Üí MCP Gateway ‚Üí Neo4j (direct structured calls)  
**Highlights:** No grounding layer; Just the cypher query is used

### Method 4: GraphRAG Pipeline  
**Flow:** Salesforce ‚Üí GraphRAG Pipeline ‚Üí Neo4j  
**Highlights:** Combines vector + graph context; provides context-rich insights for knowledge graph use cases.

## üåç Testing via cURL

**Local testing** Vector-only query
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8005/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json,text/event-stream" -d '{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call",
  "params":{"name":"run_vector_query","arguments":{"question":"Summarize communication challenges between patients and clinicians"}}
}'


```

**Remote testing**
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://d001d4abfaa9.ngrok-free.app/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json,text/event-stream"  -d  @biomolecule.json



```

**Input JSON (`biomolecule.json`)**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"tools/call",
  "params":{"name":"run_graphrag_search_withcontext","arguments":{"question":"Relate biomolecule findings to lupus clinical guidelines"}}
}

```

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Salesforce Developer Org or Sandbox  
- Neo4j database (local or Aura)  
- Node.js for MCP Gateway or Python for MCP Server  
- Basic knowledge of Apex, LWC, Cypher  

### Setup & Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/belavaditech/Salesforce-MCP-GraphRag-Neo4j.git
cd Salesforce-MCP-GraphRag-Neo4j
```

1. Configure Neo4j connection credentials.  
2. Set up MCP server (provided MCP server ) with Neo4j details.  
3. Create Named Credential in Salesforce for secure endpoint calls.  
4. Deploy Apex classes and LWC components (provided).  
5. Configure the LWC components in your application

---

---

## Configuration  

Create a `.env` file for your environment:  
```env
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
MCP_PORT=8005

```

In Salesforce:  
- Set up a **Named Credential** pointing to the MCP Gateway endpoint.  
- Assign permission sets for API calls from Apex.
